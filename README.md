# COMP303Starter
Starter project configuration for my COMP 303 Software Development course at McGill University

For this project to be correctly imported in Eclipse, you need the following configuration:

* [Eclipse Neon](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php) extended with [checkstyle](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/checkstyle-plug) and [EclEmma](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclemma-java-code-coverage);
* A properly installed Java 8 execution environment;

This project configuration will use the recommended code formatting guidelines for the course automatically when you use Eclipe's various code generation features. It will also automatically check your code for violations to style rules.
